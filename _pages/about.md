Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

Joseph John Trybala III, an aspiring academic tilting at windmills, seeking to find meaning in work. I am disconnected from social media in a big way, the worst you'll find me on is LinkedIn.

This github page is meant to serve as a kind of directory to all things me. Consider this a living document. It is not finished, and honestly should remain unfinished as long as possible. If I ever claim its finished, please call someone as I need help. Provided I haven't been slacking, this should be relatively up to date with my projects.
