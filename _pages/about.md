[Joseph John Trybala III](josephtry.github.io), an aspiring academic tilting at windmills, seeking to find meaning in work. I am disconnected from social media in a big way, the worst you'll find me on is LinkedIn. Following an adage I can't attribute to anyone, "Study what you don't know.", I have historically done research on social media. 

This github page is meant to serve as a kind of directory to all things me. Consider this a living document. It is not finished, as I am, and honestly should remain unfinished as long as possible. If I ever claim its finished, please call someone as I need help. Provided I haven't been slacking, this should be relatively up to date with my projects.
